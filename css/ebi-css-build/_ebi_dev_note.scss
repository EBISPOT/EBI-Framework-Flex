// Common rules for EMBL-EBI website elements - global and local headers and footers.
// These build atop and tweak Foundation's base styles, which we do not directly edit.
//
// We do not recommend you edit this file. Rather add any overrides using the pattern in theme-template.css,
// or if you're using Sass you can override settings in _theme_settings.scss

// Note to show in compiled CSS

  ================
  DEVELOPERS: READ BEFORE EDITING!
  ================
  If you wish to use Sass, do not edit this file. Edit ebi-global.scss
  If you don't care about Sass, delete this block and the ebi-global.scss file
    and use the compiled CSS version.
