# EBI-Framework

## Version: 1.1-dev

The current idea is to develop a framework drawing heavily off print styles and use the Foundation 6 framework. Basic support will not require jQuery (including basic responsive layouts) but will be enabled by default.

## Quick start
For a quick start, run with the HTML templates in the /sample-site directory.

## About the framework
In all, an evolutionary step of the current EMBL-EBI web compliance kit, this project aims to continue the efforts of the existing guidance by providing:

- Modularization of framework components that will:
  - Require fewer roll-your-own solutions
  - Be more robust out of the box
  - Standardization of tooling
- Update visual assets to make use of contemporary web browser features for:
  - More consistency with print visual language
  - Enhanced mobile support
- Page lifecycle tracking: An improved meta-tag based model for maintaining and tracking content freshness, ownership, and intent
- Faster development: style guide and pattern library to help accelerate development and understanding
- Regular updates: A versioning system for the framework to help track changes, features, and usage
- Collaboration: A more collaborative code base (such as hosting on GitHub) to offer a better path for code collaboration and integration
