# EBI-Framework V1.1
This is an evolutionary step of the current EMBL-EBI web compliance kit. 

It aims to conitinue the efforts of the existing guidance by:
- A more modular framework of components that will:
  - require fewer roll-your-own solutions;
  - be more robust out of the box;
  - standardidise of tooling;
- Update visual assets to make use of contemporary web browser features;
  - More consistentincy with print visual language; 
  - Enhanced mobile support; 
- An improved model for maintaining and tracking content freshness, ownership, and intent; and
- A more collaborative code base such as hosting on GitHub;

The current idea is to develop a framework drawing heavily off print styles and use the Foundation 6 framework.

Basic support will not require jQuery (including basic responsive layouts) but will be enabled by default.
