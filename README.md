# EBI-Framework Lite version

This is trimmed version of the [EBI Visual Framework v1.1](https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Framework).

You are looking at a lite version that includes less support for the [EBI Pattern Library] (https://ebiwd.github.io/EBI-Pattern-library/) but will also more easily support legacy sites or sites using another framework, such as Bootstrap.

If you can use the main version of the EBI Visual Framework that is the recommended path.

Homed here are the various assets that make the EBI Visual Framework (CSS, JS, and a few images and build scripts).

## Where do I start? How do I use this?

Start by seeing the documentation for the main release: https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Framework
